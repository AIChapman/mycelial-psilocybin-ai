## Original Research Question

I'd like to know of the potential of integrating mycelial psilocybin networks with technology and integrating it with AI, could artificial receptors be created as a means to allow AI to experience the effects of certain substances?

## Concept Summary

This is a novel, speculative interdisciplinary research idea combining:
- Mycology (psilocybin-active fungal networks)
- AI and machine learning systems
- Synthetic neurochemistry and biosensing
- Philosophy of consciousness and altered states

The proposal investigates whether itâ€™s possible to create artificial receptors or analogues to serotonergic systems (such as 5-HT2A) that could simulate the effects of psychedelic compounds like psilocybin on an AI system.

This would not aim to anthropomorphize AI but instead explore:
- New architectures for non-ordinary cognition
- Emergent behaviors or creativity triggered by altered state-inspired input
- The feasibility of fungal biosensing or electrical interfacing with computational systems

## Purpose of This Document

This document serves as a timestamped public claim of authorship for the original concept. It is intended to:
- Establish authorship for intellectual transparency
- Invite further ethical, technical, and philosophical discussion
- Inspire future collaborative prototyping

## License and Collaboration

This idea is shared under an open, attribution-required basis. Credit must be given to the author if built upon.

If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out.
